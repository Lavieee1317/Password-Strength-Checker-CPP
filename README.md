# Password Strength Checker (C++)

## Project Description
The Password Strength Checker is a console-based C++ application that evaluates the strength of a user-entered password.  
It checks the password based on commonly used security rules and classifies it as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.

This project demonstrates the use of core C++ concepts and basic cybersecurity principles.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Strings
- Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Character Handling Functions


## Features
- Checks minimum password length  
- Verifies presence of:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special characters
- Displays password strength level

## How to Run the Program
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
2. Run the executable:
3. Enter a password when prompted.
